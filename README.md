# DinnerChoice

![avatar](docs/Dinner_choice.png)

This gem is designed to record information (e.g. name, address, average price) and user-reviews of restaurants. Users are able to add restaurants entry, display restaurants list, delete any restaurant and update information. More importantly, the gem can help users make quick lunch/dinner decisions. Users can "roll the dice" to get a random selection from the restaurants list.

Have you ever spent too much time trying to make a decision as where to go for lunch or dinner? *The DinnerChoice gem is designed just for you!*
